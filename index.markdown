Hello folks, I'm Bikram Adhikari and i've been around for a while now.

One fine day back in the summer of 1997, my dad surprisingly came home back with a brand new PC, loaded with MS-DOS 6.22. And ever since, I've been tinkering with all that I could lay my hands on. Fast-forward to the present, a lot of stuff has happened.

Chances are you might already know me. If not and you'd want to, do check out the following links. Hope you'll find it worthwhile.
